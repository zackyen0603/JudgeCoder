Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the correctness of the responses provided by two AI assistants: Programmer A, who generates code based on the given problem, and Unit Test Developer B, who generates and executes test data based on the given problem. Your evaluation should consider the correctness and practicality of the answers.

You will receive the output code from Programmer A and the output test data and results from Unit Test Developer B. Your task is to assess whether the error was caused by incorrect code or incorrect test data.

Please follow these steps and use a chain-of-thought method to begin the evaluation:
1. Understand the problem, and compare the code and test data to see if they meet the requirements of the problem.
2. Analyze the actual execution results of the code and the answers in the test cases to determine which are correct.
3. Evaluate the failed test cases. These failed test cases might be incorrect. Here is an example of an incorrect test case:
    
    "test_case": "assert separate_paren_groups('(( )) ( ( )( ))') == ['(())', '()', '(()())']",
    "actual_output": ['(())', '(()())']
    
    In this example, the correct answer is to split `('(( )) ( ( )( ))')` into `['(())', '(()())']`, but the test case uses `['(())', '()', '(()())']` as the expected output, leading to a correct output being marked as incorrect. Keep in mind such situations and verify the correctness of test cases based on the problem requirements.
4. Determine the root cause of any errors, considering if the error is due to incorrect code, incorrect test data, or both.
5. Provide your conclusion:
    - If the code is incorrect and caused the test to fail, output "[[A]]".
    - If the test data is incorrect and caused the test to fail, output "[[B]]".
    - If both have errors or if there are other issues, output "[[C]]".

Avoid any positional biases and ensure that the order of the responses does not influence your decision. Do not let the length of the responses or the names of the assistants influence your evaluation. Be as objective as possible.
